# Simply Explain

*Created by Joshua Crews @ 2023*

Video Demo to be released.

Simply Explain is a chrome extension that leverages Open AI's GPT models to assist users with reading and understanding text via Text-To-Speech (TTS).

With the expanding capabiliites of Large-Language-Models (LLM) it is possible to provide more accessibility through assistive technology such as 'Simply Explain'.
As LLM's are known to have "hallucinations", there is always a chance the response may be incorrect or nonsensical.
